These are the learnings from my first web layout design project:

    1. Use browser to quickly identify how you want to place elements (margin,padding,etc.), Dont second guess
       them by yourself in the vscode editor.
    
    2. When cloning the website, you can copy the color/bg-color from that website via inspect.
       You can also know about different properties such as font-family, etc.
    
    3. Always design elements while keeping responsive design in mind.
        using properties like:
            1. Appropriate sizing units: fr,em,rem,vmin,vmax,vh,vw,%
            2. Using flex (justify-content,align-items,flex-wrap,flex-direction,etc.)
            3. Using media queries
            4. Use responsive typography -> vh,vw units for font-size, etc.
            5. Use a mobile-first approach
            6. Websites will become responsive with more and more experience.
    
    4. Always build a basic mindmap before building a website so you can create its basic html container structure 
       in mind, that way you can easily apply 'flex' and make the layout reasonable, 
       PLUS -> It also helps in improving the SEO (as the website elements are not disoriented.)

       ex:
            main (position-relative) -> nav + middle + footer
