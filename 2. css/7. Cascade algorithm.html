- When multiple css properties are applied on a single element, there's a conflict as in which of the following 
  clashing property would be applied?
- In that case -> css has a cascade algorithm that resolves those conflicts.
- CASCADE ALGORITHM:
    1. Origin: authored css would be given priority rather than browser/browser-implied css
    2. Within authored css, when different types of selectors (hybrid) are addressed to used to address the element:
        in that case, the selector with the most specificity is implied
        In short, the specificity order is:
            Inline 'STYLE' > Id selector > class selector/attribute selector > element selector > universal selector
        To calculate specific 'specificity', we use the following rules:
            (i) element selector, pseudo element selector: 1
            (ii) class selector, attribute selector, pseudo class selector: 10
            (iii) id selector: 100
            (iv) inline style: 1000
    3. When the specificity is the same, the last (most recent) selector wins
    4. Using '!Important' tag helps override all the specificity and give the utmost priority to that selector.


    Lets practice calculating specificity of some of the selectors here:
        (a) <h1 id="title" class="h1">CodeWithHarry</h1>
                -> 1 + 100 + 10 = 111
        
        (b) a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover {
            color: red;
            }
                -> 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 41
