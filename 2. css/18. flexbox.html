FLEX's properties that are applied on the CONTAINER: (cant be applied on the items)
    FLEX is mostly used to center elements both horizontally and vertically. This is its usecase 70% of the time.
    horizontally: ('justify-content' : main-axis)
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;  (center/flex-start/flex-end/etc.)
    vertically: ('align-items' : cross-axis)
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;      (center/flex-start/flex-end/etc.)


    When you apply 'display:flex', the items are directly oriented from left-right bcoz its the default 'flex-direction'
    so if you wanna change that you can, by:
        flex-direction: column;   (main-axis: vertical, cross-axis: horizontal)
        flex-direction: column-reverse;    (main-axis: vertical, cross-axis: horizontal)
        flex-direction: row; (main-axis: horizontal, cross-axis: vertical)
        flex-direction: row-reverse;    (main-axis: horizontal, cross-axis: vertical)


    When 'display: flex' and the container's overflowing, to wrap the contents inside of a container, we use:
    'flex-wrap' : wrap;  (can also use wrap-reverse, 'no-wrap' is a default one)


    When we've got multiple lines instead of one line to be centered:
    we use 'align-content' instead of align-items
    and for main-axis we already use justify-content (for both multiple/single lines) (there's no such justify-item)


    You can combine 'flex-direction' & 'flex-wrap' to 'flex-flow'
    flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>

    'gap: xpx' (can be 'row-gap' & 'column-gap')  (or -> gap: 2px 4px (this means gap: row-gap column-gap))
        this defines the gap btw the items of the containers
    

FLEX's properties that are applied on the items: (cant be applied to the container)
        1.  you can set the order in which the items in a container by using the following property:
                order: 3; (example)
                the higher the order, the later the element will be shown.
                default order = 0
                and if same order, then the first one to be written will be shown first (as per Cascade algorithm)
        2.  'flex-grow: 1;'
                this means that all the items will be covering only 1 row and will be covering equal area (individually)
                if then a certain item is made: 'flex-grow: 2;' then it means that the particular item will cover
                twice the space than normal items in the row.
        3.  'flex-shrink: 2;'
                the item or items that its applied on means that when the screen-size is reduced; they'll shrink with it but twice as fast than the normal/regular speed.

        4.  'align-self:flex-start;' (or any other)
                its similarly like align-item (for 1 line) , align-content (for multiple lines) 
                so 'align-self' is for one individual item.
