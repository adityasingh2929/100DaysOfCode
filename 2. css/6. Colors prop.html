<!-- 
Colors can be represented in:
    1. color keywords
    2. hexcodes
    3. rgb values
    4. rgba values
    5. hsl values

    best is '2. hexcodes' as its easy to remember and gives exact color for browser to implement otherwise if we use
    '1.' method then, it can still be diff for diff browsers (ex: red can be of diff shades for diff browsers.).
