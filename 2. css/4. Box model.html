<!-- 
so every element is a BOX for CSS:
its like:

   ===============================
   |         Margin              |
   |  ========================   |
   |  |      Border           |  |
   |  |  ===================  |  |
   |  |  |   Padding       |  |  |
   |  |  |  ============   |  |  |
   |  |  |  |  Content  |  |  |  |
   |  |  |  ============   |  |  |
   |  |  ===================  |  |
   |  ========================  |
   ===============================

- By default, when we write height and width -> it takes into account only the CONTENT.
  whereas when we include a declaration called: box-sizing: border-box with height and width -> it takes into account up untill the border. (no margin)

- Incase of total width and total height, we caluclate up untill the margin.

- Ok, so here, when we've got two 'div' besides each other, both have a margin value: lets say 25px, 
  then would the margin btw to boxes side, would be 50px? the ans. is no:
      -> There will always be one of the two margins (of two 'div') applicable, i.e only the bigger one will be considered,
         the other one will collapse (only on the side where two boxes are facing each other). 
      -> Here both the margins were 25px so it remained 25px, if lets say one of the margin was to be 35px and the other
         remained at 25px, then in that case: margin of 35px will be applicable.
