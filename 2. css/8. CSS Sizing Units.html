                                 CSS Sizing Units - Quick Breakdown

Types of sizing units:
    In CSS, there are a lot of sizing units that are used to determine the size of the elements/content.
    Some of the most common ones / most frequently used ones are:
        1. PX:
            ->  'Pixels'; pixels are the smallest dot on your screen that make up the monitor.
                In your case, your screen is of 1920*1080 resolution, which means it has a 
                total of 1920 pixels on its full width and a total of 1080 pixels on its total height,
                so when we say 5px, its taking around that much pixels on the screen (in 'height' or 'width' ->
                that depends on the property.)
            ->  Pixels are not a responsive way of size unit to use (5px will look diff on people with devices of different size);
                However they can be if we use Media Queries (More on that later).
            

        2. VW: 
            -> 'Viewport Width' -> this is a responsive size unit.
            -> width: 80vw would mean that the element will cover 80% of the screen's width; no matter if its a
               laptop or a phone.
        
        3. VH:
            -> 'Viewport Height' -> this is also a responsive size unit.
            -> height: 80vh would mean that the element will cover 80% of the screen's height; no matter if its a
               laptop or a phone.


        -> NOTE: Before we go into 4. & 5.  i.e 'rem' & 'em' unit of sizing. We must know that the font-size is an
                 inheriting property, i.e if given at one place, it'll be inherited to every other element.
        -> NOTE: <html> is our root element, so if someone does this:
                 html {
                     font-size: 20px;
                 }
                 and then there's no mention of the font size anywhere in the code, then all the standard texts will
                 be of 20px size as it'll be inherited to them. (obv h1 will be diff with p tag, but p tag will 
                 remain at 20px)


        4. REM (Root EM)
               -> What it means: rem stands for "root em"
               -> It’s relative to the root <html> element’s font size
               -> By default, browsers set the root font size to 16px
               -> Ex:
                     html {
                         font-size: 16px;
                         }

                     p {
                         font-size: 2rem; /* 2 × 16px = 32px */
                     }

        5. em — Relative to the parent
            -> What it means: em is relative to the font size of the parent element
            -> It can cascade, meaning it can get bigger or smaller depending on nesting
            -> Ex:
                   div {
                       font-size: 20px;
                   }

                   p {
                       font-size: 1.5em; /* 30px */
                   }

                   span {
                       font-size: 1.5em; /* 1.5 × 30px = 45px */
                   }
        -> If nested inside another element using em, it multiplies from that.

        -> If there's no font-size mentioned for the parent, then 2em would make it: 32px
           given that the root em is: 16px



        6. vmin:
            -> width: 1vmin would mean that the element will take 1% of the smaller dimension side of the device
                      'IN WIDTH'. (ex: 5vmin when 800*600 resolution -> 30px)
            -> vmin for phones would be width, vmin for laptops/tablets would be height
            -> these are responsive sizing units.
            -> 5vmin width of 800*600 device would mean 5% of the smaller dimension of the device (which is 600px in this case), so 30px.

        
        7. vmax:
            -> height: 1vmax would mean that the element will take 1% of the bigger dimension side of the device
                      'IN HEIGHT'. (ex: 5vmax when 800*600 resolution -> 40px)
            -> vmax for phones would be height, vmax for laptops/tablets would be width
            -> these are responsive sizing units.
            -> 5vmax height of 800*600 device would mean 5% of the larger dimension of the device (which is 800px in this case), so 40px.

        -> NOTE: vmin is used when we're trying to fit things safely (text,etc)
                 vmax is when we want to keep things large, even in portrait mode (banners,etc)

        8. %:
            -> its a relative unit. (relative to parent.)
               when height: 50%; it means that the height of the element will be 50% of its parent.
               same case for the width.
            -> You cannot assign any element this '%' unit as its mandatory that its parent's height/width should be
               already set. if its not specified, then on what basis would you apply it?


        9. min-height & min-width:
            -> If you set any element's 'min-height: 40vh;' lets say the element is div, then even if there's
               nothing present in 'div' still its height would be 40% of the device's height, and if there's too 
               much information, the div's size can increase...as we've only set min-height so there's no issue
               in div's height inc. in case of more info being added in it.

            -> Same goes for min-width.
        

        10. You shouldn't use a div or any block/semantic tag inside a p tag — it’s invalid HTML.

        11. height: 80vw;
            → sets the element’s height to 80% of the viewport's width.

        12. width: 80vh;
            → sets the element’s width to 80% of the viewport's height

        13. There are also lesser-used units like ch, ex, and auto, but these are more niche and used in specific cases.
