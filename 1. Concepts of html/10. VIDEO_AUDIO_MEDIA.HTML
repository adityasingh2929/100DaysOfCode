<!-- 
1. controls -> provides vid controls such as speed,pause,etc.
2. loop -> the vid will be played in loop untill stopped.
3. autoplay -> the vid will start playing automatically as soon as the page loads.
4. muted -> the video will be in muted mode by-default, though; you can unmute it (obviously).
5. poster -> it'll be the thumbnail of the video.
6. Width nd Height
7. preload="none" -> default value where no audio is downloaded in adv. 
   preload="metadata" -> browser will automatically load only the meta info about the audio
   preload = "auto" -> browser will pre-load i.e download the audio.

8. SVG is a format where we can create a high quality image.
9. VIDEO,AUDIO,SVG's content comes in one line, hence are called in-line elements
10. to embed a website in ur website (as like preview, not link), you can use iframe and use its attr. such as width,height,src
    In case of yt videos; do not share the url, click on vid's share button and then embedd. you'll directly get the iframe embed code for that video via youtube.
    You can also start the embedded vid at any point.
