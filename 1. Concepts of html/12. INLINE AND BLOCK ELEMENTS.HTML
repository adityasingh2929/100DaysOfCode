NOTES:
i. Inline elements: elements which only take so much of width, i.e required   [ex: 'a' tag, span tag]
ii. Block elements are elements which take all the available space there is. (i.e phail kr baithte hai) [ex: div,p,etc]
iii. So as we can see here, we can fit consecutive inline tags in a same line as they allow it, but when we use block element,
we directly go to a brand new line as block elements always require whole line (or lines) reserved for themselves.
BUT BUT BUT, we can change this inline and block by changing their display properties by using css [as you did in your html portfolio project.]
iv. Now how will we know which elm's block and which elm's inline? -> We'll know with practice.
v. Here's some list of most common block elements:
    div
    p
    h1
    ul
    ol
    li
    form
    table
    section
    header
    footer
    nav 
    article
    pre
    aside
    main
    blockquote
    dl -> description list

    basically -> most of the semantic tags (except: span) and some content tags [p,h1,etc.] (except: b,i,u,q)

vi. Here's some list of most common inline elements:
    a
    span
    b
    i
    u
    q
    em -> emphasis
    sub -> subscript
    sup -> superscript
