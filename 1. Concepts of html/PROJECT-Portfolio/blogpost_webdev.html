            In recent years, countless aspiring developers have asked: Is web development saturated? It's a valid concern. With the rise of bootcamps, free online courses, and coding tutorials flooding YouTube and Udemy, it seems like "everyone is becoming a web developer." But let’s step back.

            Yes, the number of entry-level developers has exploded. However, so has the demand for digital services. Startups, content creators, nonprofits, and small businesses need custom sites, landing pages, dashboards, and integrations. Companies want value, not just a developer. That means clean code, UX awareness, performance optimization, and business understanding. While building a basic React site is no longer impressive, offering end-to-end value is.

            Web development is not dying — it's evolving. Tools like Next.js, Astro, and full-stack frameworks are raising the bar. AI is automating boilerplate work, but it’s also creating room for more complex, creative challenges. The market isn't saturated — it's stratified. The question isn’t “Can you code?” It’s “Can you solve problems that matter?”
