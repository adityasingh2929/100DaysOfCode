            There’s a growing fear that AI will replace jobs — especially in tech. But here’s the twist: AI might not replace you — someone using AI better than you will.

            Think of AI as a power tool. It’s not here to write entire apps alone (yet), but it's already making developers, designers, marketers, and even writers 2x–5x more productive. The ones learning to collaborate with AI — prompt engineers, devs using Copilot, designers using AI prototyping tools — are doing more in less time.

            This shift is less about automation, more about augmentation. If you resist it, you'll fall behind. If you adapt, you become exponentially more capable. The future belongs not to the machine, but to the person who knows how to wield it.
