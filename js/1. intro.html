JavaScript: Client-Side vs Server-Side
    JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used in two major environments:

    Client-Side (Frontend)

    Server-Side (Backend)

        🖥️ 1. Client-Side JavaScript
            Purpose: Enhances user interfaces and user interactions directly in the browser.

            Where it runs: In the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

            Integration: internal or external (via script tag)

                Internal:
                    Written inside <script> tags in HTML.

                    html
                    Copy
                    Edit
                    <script>
                    alert("Hello, world!");
                    </script>
                External: 
                    Linked via src attribute in the <script> tag.

                    html
                    Copy
                    Edit
                    <script src="main.js"></script>
            Capabilities:

                Manipulate HTML and CSS (DOM)

                Show alerts, prompts, confirmations

                Handle user events like clicks or form submissions

            Limitations:

                Cannot access server-side resources like databases directly

                Security restrictions (sandboxed environment)

        ⚙️ 2. Server-Side JavaScript (Node.js)
            What is Node.js?
                Node.js is a runtime environment created by Ryan Dahl that allows JavaScript to run on the server, powered by the V8 engine (originally from Chrome), embedded in C++.

            Purpose:
                Handles backend operations like:

                Accessing databases

                Building APIs

                File system operations

                Server creation and request handling

            Where it runs: On the server (e.g., your computer or hosting service), not in the browser.

            Execution:

                Typically run via command line or terminal:

                bash
                Copy
                Edit
                node app.js
                Outputs are seen in the terminal, not in the browser console.

            Capabilities:

                Full access to the file system

                Can install external modules via npm (Node Package Manager)

                Powerful for backend services and API development

            Limitations:

                Cannot directly manipulate the DOM

                No access to browser-specific functions like alert, prompt, etc. 


ALSO, KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU CAN RUN BACKEND JS ON FRONTEND (UR BROWSER) AND FRONTEND JS ON BACKEND (UR SERVER),
AS LONG AS THEY DONT HAVE THOSE CLASHING FUNCTIONS (THAT ARE IN ONE, BUT ABSENT IN ANOTHER).
